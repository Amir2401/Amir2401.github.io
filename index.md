# Hello and welcome to my blog! 

I am a student of Genomics at the Unversity of Bologna and here I share things that are generally related to (but not only) genetics and molecular biology.

Posts from this blog are mostly text versions of my videos that I upload on Youtube, but not always. So check out [The Molecular Insight](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChHK9BvxI0r2lDsVVwN84Dw).
