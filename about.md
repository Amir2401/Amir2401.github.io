# About

My name is Amir Rakhimov, I am a student of Genomics at the University of Bologna. I like genomics (what a surprise), memes and cinema. I also like to play the guitar and basketball. In this blog I will post things that I find interesting. 

I also have a Youtube channel, [The Molecular Insight](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChHK9BvxI0r2lDsVVwN84Dw), where I post videos realted to science. Check it out!
